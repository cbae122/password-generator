# Random Password Generator

## Description
- Motivation to build a random password generator was based on the past couple of classes. Classes were taught on Javascript and the behind tools of how Javascript can make a website interactive.
- I built the random password generator to take what I've learned these past couple of days during bootcamp. We learned that we can have Javascript call a function and execute said function to make a tool based on the needs a person might have.
- This project solves the problem if you need to create a random password using up to four different criteria.
- I learned that Javascript allows your website/tool to function. It takes your variables and applies them to functions and executes the functions based on your needs which is defined in the if and else if statements.

## Usage
- How to use the random password generator:
- Click "Generate Password"
- Confirm the length of your password.
- Click "OK" or "Cancel" on the four criteria you want your password to contain.
- Password will be generated in the window.
- See screenshot below as example
